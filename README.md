Browse a cover image (eg.: [Darling In The FranXX's](./cover.png)) and expand `Add Custom CSS`:

## Custom Cover
Before saving your new theme, select `Preview` and adjust the cover's css margin to fit the picture:


```css
#cover-image-container.image-container #cover-image {
    width: 100%;
    height: 450px;
    margin-top: -240px;
}
```
When you're done, save it and enjoy.
