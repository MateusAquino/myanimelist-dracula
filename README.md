## Install
Change you're default Anime/Manga MyAnimeList theme to Dark Blue (https://myanimelist.net/ownlist/style) and click it so you can edit it's CSS.  
Browse a cover image ([click here](./cover.png) to download Darling In The FranXX's) and expand `Add Custom CSS`:  
The custom CSS can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dracula/dracula-theme/master/README.md).  
Save it, and you are done!  
  
However, if you wish to use your own cover image instead, you may have to change some CSS settings as explained below.

## Custom Cover
Before saving your new theme, select `Preview` and adjust the cover's css margin to fit the picture:


```css
#cover-image-container.image-container #cover-image {
    width: 100%;
    height: 450px;
    margin-top: -240px;
}
```
When you're done, save it and enjoy.
